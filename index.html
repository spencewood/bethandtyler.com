        Did that? Great. Wondering who we are or how we decided to get married? Well we both moved to Colorado in 2007. We met through mutual friends at a comedy club and hit it off immediately. In 2009 we moved back to Beth's home state of Minnesota. Beth supervises at a local nonprofit and Tyler is a web developer. We adopted a hedgehog who they named Mumford who you can see here. 

        After almost 5 years of dating Tyler popped the question in the middle of the winter kneeling in the snow at Irvine Park in Saint Paul, and we decided right then and there that we would get married there in the park. We are very excited and hope you can help us celebrate!

            Irvine park is a small city park with limited parking and no bathrooms. Be sure to leave plenty of time to find parking if you drive. If you are staying in the Crown hotel, there will be shuttles provided. If you prefer the local bus, the park is on [4 local bus lines](http://metrotransit.org/TripPlanner/NearestLandmarkResult.aspx?strOrig=irvine+park&amp;cat=SVC).

            We will have a limited number of parking permits for spaces on the road surrounding the park.

            If this all sounds too complicated and you prefer to join us at the reception we will not be offended!

            *In case of severe weather, we will move the ceremony to the reception site at 5:30 &mdash; see below.*

            The Wabasha Street Caves were a working speakeasy run by gangsters in the 1920s. It is a man made cave so don't expect stalactites. It does have a stage, dance floor, and built-in bar.

            We will be having a "gangster tour" of the caves to start the reception, it will be the only opportunity to see the back caves so don't miss it!

            The caves has 2 parking lots reserved only for this event.

            We will have shuttles running back to the hotel for those who stay there.

        Dear friends and family,

        Your presence at our wedding is gift enough, but if you do wish to celebrate our wedding with a gift, a contribution towards our dream of traveling in Asia for our honeymoon would be appreciated.
