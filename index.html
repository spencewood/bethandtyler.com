        Wondering who we are or how we decided to get married? Well we both moved to Colorado in 2007. We met through mutual friends at a comedy club and hit it off immediately. In 2009 we moved back to Beth's home state of Minnesota. Beth supervises at a local nonprofit and Tyler is a web developer. We adopted a hedgehog who they named Mumford who you can see [here](http://www.mumfordthehedgehog.com). 

        After almost 5 years of dating Tyler popped the question in the middle of the winter kneeling in the snow at Irvine Park in Saint Paul. We decided right then and there that we would get married there in the park. We are very excited and hope you can help us celebrate!

            Irvine park is a small city park with limited parking and no bathrooms. Be sure to leave plenty of time to find parking if you drive. If you are staying in the Crown hotel, there will be shuttles provided. If you prefer the local bus, the park is on [4 local bus lines](http://metrotransit.org/TripPlanner/NearestLandmarkResult.aspx?strOrig=irvine+park&amp;cat=SVC).

            We will have a limited number of parking permits for spaces on the road surrounding the park.

            If this all sounds too complicated and you prefer to join us at the reception we will not be offended!

            *In case of severe weather, we will move the ceremony to the reception site at 5:30 &mdash; see below.*

            The Wabasha Street Caves were a working speakeasy run by gangsters in the 1920s. It is a man made cave so don't expect stalactites. It does have a stage, dance floor, and built-in bar.

            We will be having a "gangster tour" of the caves to start the reception, it will be the only opportunity to see the back caves so don't miss it!

            The caves has 2 parking lots reserved only for this event.

            We will have shuttles running back to the hotel for those who stay there.

    faqs:
      - question: So, is Beth changing her name?
        answer: Yes, and so is Tyler. It is important to us that we have the same name, but liked the idea of creating something new together. Since "Coward" wasn't our favorite idea, we decided to combine our middle names which is also both of our mother's last names (Southwood and Spencer). After the wedding our last names will become our middle names and our last name will be "Spencewood". Let the paperwork begin.
      - question: What should I expect?
        answer: The ceremony is outside and will be fairly short. The reception will start right after the ceremony and will start with a tour of the caves so make sure to get there in time, you won't want to miss it. 
      - question: When will the shuttles run?
        answer: That will be posted here closer to the event.
      - question: Will there be food?
        answer: "We will be serving Tyler's favorite wedding food at the reception: a taco buffet."
