        Did that? Great. Wondering who we are or how we decided to get married? Well we both moved to Colorado in 2007. We met through mutual friends at a comedy club and hit it off immediately. In 2009 we moved back to Beth's home state of Minnesota. Beth supervises at a local nonprofit and Tyler is a web developer. We adopted a hedgehog who they named Mumford who you can see here. 

        After almost 5 years of dating Tyler popped the question in the middle of the winter kneeling in the snow at Irvine Park in Saint Paul, and we decided right then and there that we would get married there in the park. We are very excited and hope you can help us celebrate!

            Irvine park is a small city park with limited parking and no bathrooms. If you chose to drive leave plenty of time to find parking. We will have a limited number of parking permits for spaces on the road surrounding the park for those who need it. If you prefer to join us at the reception we will not be offended!

        Dear friends and family,

        Your presence at our wedding is gift enough, but if you do wish to celebrate our wedding with a gift, a contribution towards our dream of traveling in Asia for our honeymoon would be appreciated. We are also registered at [REI](http://www.rei.com), [Crate and Barrel](http://www.crateandbarrel.com/), and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html?ie=UTF8&amp;id=20W99LYEII86P&amp;type=wedding).

        Beth &amp; Tyler
